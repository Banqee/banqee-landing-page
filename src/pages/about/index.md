### The new way to bank internationally
We are a company founded by free spirits, inspired to create the first premier global banking experience by the excessive amounts of time and money lost to outdated banking standards. Before Banqee, living or working abroad required juggling bank accounts, paying tons of fees, and planning weeks in advance for the most simplest of financial transactions. We knew it didn’t have to be this way, and decided to act. We created Banqee because managing bank accounts and paying bills between multiple countries is complicated, but managing your finances doesn’t have to be.

### Unified account
Banqee eliminates the stress, hassle and fees of managing bank accounts across countries. By providing our customers with one unified account and a debit card with no FX and bank ATM fees, we make it fast, easy and affordable to get a quick snapshot of your finances and manage money internationally so that you can get back to living an amazing life.

Banqee is based in Manhattan, New York, Merida, Mexico and London, United Kingdom. We’re supported by advisors with countless years of industry experience and by one of the world’s most respected financial institutions, BBVA. Together, we are working to craft creative solutions for our customers.

For now, we’re in a limited beta, meaning only select customers with bank accounts in UK and the U.S. can open a Banqee account. But we anticipate adding more countries and additional beta users, with a full launch to come later in 2020.

We look forward to welcoming you as a member to the Banqee family.
